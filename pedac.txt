  When you hit '/', you see "Header" and "ListTestTable"
  When you click on a slice, you see "Header" and "TestPage"
      When you hit "Back" in your browser, you see "Header" and "ListTestTable"

Test results (/tests/:testName)
  By default, we render:
    - navigationBar with step1 highlighted
    - stats for step 1
    - chart for step 1
  If you click on a step tab of the nav bar, we render:
    - dito for the step clicked
  If you click on one of the items of the chart legend, we toggle visibility for:
    - the linechart of that metric
    - the axis of that metric
  If you hover over data points, a tooltip should displayed
